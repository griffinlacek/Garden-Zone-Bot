# Tic-Tac-Toe-Bot

@GardenZoneBot is a twitter bot written in Ruby for finding the USDA Hardines Zone of a specific zip code.

If a tweet mentions @GardenZoneBot and includes a valid zipcode, @GardenZoneBot will reply back to the user with the USDA Hardiness Zone and the corresponding USDA state zone map.

Hardiness Zone refers to the "standard" by which gardeners and growers can determine which plants are likely to thrive at a location. It is based on the average annual minimum winter-temperature and zones are divided into 10-degree Farenheight zones.
